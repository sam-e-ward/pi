# Agent Tooling Setup Guide

This repo contains configuration, agents, and install scripts for each CLI coding agent I use. Each tool gets its own directory (e.g. `pi/`, `opencode/`) with a consistent set of components adapted to that tool's conventions.

This guide defines what each directory should include and why.

## 1. Install Script (`install.sh`)

A single entry point that makes the tool fully operational from a fresh clone.

### Must do

- **Check the CLI is on PATH.** If not, look for it in common locations (e.g. `/opt/homebrew/bin/`) and symlink it to `/usr/local/bin/` (or prompt the user).
- **Symlink configuration files** into wherever the tool reads its config from (e.g. `~/.pi/agent/` for pi, `~/.config/opencode/` for opencode). Back up any existing real files before overwriting.
- **Symlink agents** from the repo's `agents/` directory into the tool's agent directory.
- **Install dependencies** if any components need them (e.g. npm packages for extensions).
- **Be idempotent.** Running it twice should produce the same result — skip symlinks that already point to the right place, don't duplicate shell config entries.

### Nice to have

- Configure shell integration (e.g. wrapper functions in `.zshrc.local`).
- Register the repo as a package/plugin if the tool supports it.
- Print a summary of what was linked and a "verify it works" command.

### Template

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

REPO_DIR="$(cd "$(dirname "$0")" && pwd)"
CONFIG_DIR="<tool-specific config path>"

# 1. Check CLI is available
if ! command -v <tool> &>/dev/null; then
  # Attempt to find and symlink, or error out
fi

# 2. Symlink global config
symlink_file "$REPO_DIR/AGENTS.md" "$CONFIG_DIR/AGENTS.md"

# 3. Symlink agents
for agent in "$REPO_DIR"/agents/*.md; do
  symlink_file "$agent" "$CONFIG_DIR/agents/$(basename "$agent")"
done

# 4. Tool-specific setup (extensions, packages, etc.)
```

## 2. Global Instructions (`AGENTS.md`)

The system-level prompt that applies to every session and subagent. This is the most important file — it shapes all agent behaviour.

### Must include

#### Bash safety rules
Agents must never run long-lived processes (dev servers, watchers, `docker compose up`). Include:
- An explicit blocklist of common offenders (`npm run dev`, `yarn start`, `vite`, etc.)
- Safe alternatives (build commands, background + timeout patterns, curl checks)
- A clear explanation of _why_ — the agent hangs forever if a command doesn't exit

#### Git workflow
Define how the agent handles version control across all repos:

- **Before work:** Check `git status`. If there are uncommitted changes, summarise them and ask before proceeding.
- **After work:** Stage and commit with a plain english message. No conventional commit prefixes.
- **On follow-up:** Classify intent before acting:
  - **Fix it** — soft reset the last commit, apply fixes, recommit (keeps one clean commit)
  - **Build on it** — leave previous commit, start new work
  - **Scrap it** — stash the changes with a description, revert

This workflow keeps history clean without requiring the user to manage git manually.

#### Code style
Short rules: match existing patterns, small functions, descriptive names, comments only where non-obvious.

### Adapt per tool
Different tools have different config formats. Some use markdown files, some use TOML/YAML, some embed instructions in a config block. The _content_ should be equivalent; the _format_ must match what the tool expects.

## 3. Agents

Reusable subagent definitions. Each agent has a single role and a tightly scoped prompt. The set below covers the core development loop:

| Agent | Role | Key constraints |
|---|---|---|
| **scout** | Fast codebase recon — grep/find/read to gather minimal context | Max 10 files, output under 100 lines, never modify anything |
| **planner** | Turn requirements + context into a concrete implementation plan | Read-only, plan under 50 lines, one action per step |
| **developer** | Write code — features, fixes, refactors | Match existing patterns, work incrementally, verify with build/test |
| **code-review** | Combined quality + architecture review | Read-only, flag issues by severity |
| **code-quality** | Focused review for duplication, complexity, dead code, accretion | Read-only |
| **arch-review** | Check implementation against architecture philosophy | Read-only, references `philosophy.md` |
| **plan-checker** | Verify the implementation matches the original plan | Read-only, diff plan vs reality |
| **ui-qa** | Visual/functional testing via browser automation | Takes screenshots, checks interactions |

### Format per tool

Each tool has its own agent definition format:

- **pi**: Markdown files with YAML frontmatter (`name`, `description`, `tools`)
- **opencode**: Check the tool's docs — may use TOML, markdown, or config entries

The prompt content can be identical or near-identical across tools. Only the wrapper format changes.

### Principles for writing agents

- **One job per agent.** If the prompt says "and also...", split it into two agents.
- **Explicit constraints.** State what the agent must NOT do (no writes, no servers, max output length).
- **Structured output.** Define the exact output format so the next agent (or the user) can consume it predictably.
- **Minimal scope on tools.** Only grant the tools the agent actually needs (e.g. scout gets `read` and `bash`, not `edit` or `write`).

## 4. Authentication Guide (`auth.md`)

A short reference for how to configure API keys for the tool.

### Must cover

- **Where credentials go** — file path and format (JSON, TOML, env vars, etc.)
- **Which providers are supported** — Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, OpenRouter, etc.
- **Key formats accepted** — literal keys, environment variable names, shell commands (e.g. `!op read ...` for 1Password)
- **Minimal example** — a copy-pasteable config block with placeholder values

### Keep it short

This is a reference, not a tutorial. Someone who already has API keys should be able to set it up in under a minute.

---

## 5. Architecture Philosophy (`philosophy.md`)

A set of principles that the `arch-review` agent checks code against. This file is project-agnostic by default but is designed to be customised per-project.

### Standard sections

- **Module boundaries** — what can import what
- **Separation of concerns** — where business logic, data access, and presentation live
- **Dependency direction** — always inward (UI → Features → Domain → Core)
- **Naming & organisation** — domain language, group by feature not file type
- **Data flow** — state ownership, side effect containment
- **Anti-patterns** — concrete signs of architecture degradation (5+ imports, god files, circular deps)

This file is the same across all tools — it's about the _code_, not the agent tool.

---

## 6. Team Implement (`team-implement`)

A compound command (skill, extension, or macro — depending on the tool) that chains agents together to go from a user prompt to reviewed, checked code. It runs the full development loop automatically.

### Flow

### Phase details

| Phase | Agent | Input | Output | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1. Recon** | `scout` | User prompt | Compressed context (files, types, architecture) | Max 10 files, 100 lines |
| **2. Plan** | `planner` | User prompt + scout output | Numbered implementation plan | Read-only, under 50 lines |
| **3. Develop** | `developer` | Plan + scout context | Code changes | Builds/tests to verify |
| **4a. Review** | `code-review` | Changed files | Issues (critical/warning/info) | Parallel with 4b |
| **4b. Arch Review** | `arch-review` | Changed files + philosophy.md | Architecture violations | Parallel with 4a |
| **5. Plan Check** | `plan-checker` | Original plan + changed files | Pass/fail + gaps | Determines if loop continues |

### Loop logic

After each develop → review → plan-check cycle:

1. **Exit the loop** if:
   - Plan checker passes AND no critical/warning review issues
   - Maximum of 3 development loops reached (exit with summary of remaining issues)

2. **Loop again** if:
   - There are critical or warning issues from code-review or arch-review
   - Plan checker identifies missing plan steps
   - Feed the combined review feedback + plan gaps back to the developer as the next iteration's input

### What gets passed between agents

Each agent receives only what it needs:

- **Scout** gets the raw user prompt
- **Planner** gets the user prompt + scout's structured output
- **Developer** gets the plan + scout context (first loop) or plan + review feedback (subsequent loops)
- **Code Review / Arch Review** get the list of changed files (from `git diff`)
- **Plan Checker** gets the original plan + the current state of changed files

### Implementing per tool

The mechanism differs by tool, but the logic is the same:

- **pi**: Implement as an extension or skill that uses `subagent` calls in a chain/loop. Pi's `subagent` tool supports `chain` mode for sequential handoff and `parallel` mode for the review phase.
- **opencode**: Check if the tool supports macros, workflows, or scripted agent chains. If not, implement as a shell script that invokes the CLI repeatedly, piping output between calls.

### Example pseudocode

```
context = invoke(scout, user_prompt)
plan = invoke(planner, user_prompt + context)

for i in 1..3:
    if i == 1:
        invoke(developer, plan + context)
    else:
        invoke(developer, plan + context + feedback)

    review_issues = invoke_parallel(
        code_review(changed_files),
        arch_review(changed_files)
    )
    plan_gaps = invoke(plan_checker, plan + changed_files)

    if no critical issues AND plan passes:
        break

    feedback = review_issues + plan_gaps

report summary
```

### Output

When the loop completes, report:

- **What was done** — list of changed files with one-line descriptions
- **Loop count** — how many dev iterations it took
- **Remaining issues** — any warnings/info items not addressed (if max loops hit)
- **How to verify** — build/test commands to run

### Token efficiency

Multi-agent loops burn through tokens fast. Every design decision in `team-implement` should be made with cost in mind. This is the single biggest risk with compound commands — a sloppy implementation will drain API budgets in minutes.

#### Compress between handoffs

The output of each agent is the input to the next — and every token of input is a token you pay for. Agents must produce **minimal structured output**, not prose. This is why scout caps at 100 lines and planner at 50. If an agent's output format isn't enforced tightly, the downstream cost compounds at every stage.

When passing context between agents, strip anything the next agent doesn't need. The developer doesn't need the scout's full output on loop 2 — it needs the review feedback and the plan. Don't re-send what hasn't changed.

#### Use tool-native features to limit context

Every tool has mechanisms to control what the model sees. Use them aggressively:

- **pi**: Subagents get isolated context by default — they don't inherit the parent's conversation history. Use this. Don't pass the full conversation; pass only the structured handoff.
- **opencode / others**: Check for equivalent isolation features (separate sessions, context windows, system prompt injection). If the tool doesn't isolate subagent context, simulate it by starting fresh invocations rather than appending to a single conversation.

#### Scope file reads narrowly

Review agents are the biggest token risk — they need to read code, but they don't need to read _all_ the code. Always scope reviews to `git diff` output (changed files only), not the whole codebase. If the tool supports passing line ranges or file lists to agents, use that rather than letting the agent `read` entire files and decide what's relevant.

#### Keep agent prompts short

Agent definition files are injected as system or user context on every invocation. A 200-line agent prompt that runs 8 times across a loop costs 1,600 lines of input tokens for the prompts alone. Keep them tight — the existing agents are deliberately terse for this reason.

#### Fail fast, don't gold-plate

The loop exists to catch real problems, not to iterate to perfection:

- **Only loop on critical/warning issues.** Info-level findings are reported at the end, not fed back for another dev cycle.
- **Merge review + arch-review feedback into a single concise list** before handing back to the developer. Don't send two full review outputs — deduplicate and compress.
- **If loop 2 produces the same issues as loop 1**, exit early. The developer isn't going to fix them on loop 3 either. Report them and let the user intervene.

#### Prefer smaller models where possible

Not every agent needs the most capable (and most expensive) model. If the tool supports per-agent model selection:

- **Scout, plan-checker**: These are read-only with structured output. A smaller, cheaper model is often sufficient.
- **Developer, planner**: These benefit from the strongest model available.
- **Code-review, arch-review**: Mid-tier — they need reasoning but don't generate code.

Check what the tool supports. Pi allows model overrides; other tools may have equivalent config.

---

## Tool-Specific Extras

Some tools support additional customisation that doesn't fit the categories above. Put these in the tool's directory but don't expect them to be portable:

- **pi**: Extensions (`pi-extensions/`), themes (`pi-theme/`), intercepted commands (`intercepted-commands/`), skills (`skills/`)
- **opencode**: TBD — check what the tool supports and add equivalent directories as needed

---

## Adding a New Tool

1. Create a directory: `<tool>/`
2. Write `install.sh` following the template above
3. Copy `AGENTS.md` and adapt the format (content stays the same where possible)
4. Copy agent definitions from `pi/agents/` and reformat for the new tool
5. Write `auth.md` for the tool's credential setup
6. Symlink or copy `philosophy.md` (it's tool-agnostic)
7. Add any tool-specific extras
8. Test: run `install.sh`, start the tool, verify agents are available
