# Architecture Philosophy

This document defines the architectural principles that all code in this project should adhere to. The `arch-review` agent checks implementations against these principles during the development cycle.

Customize this file to match your project's actual architecture. Delete or modify any section that doesn't apply.

## Module Boundaries

Define which modules exist and what they're allowed to import.

### Principles

- **Domain modules** (e.g., `core/`, `domain/`) must not import from `infrastructure/`, `api/`, or `ui/`
- **Infrastructure modules** may import from domain but never the reverse
- **Feature modules** depend on shared/core modules, never on other feature modules directly
- Public APIs are exported through index files — internal files are never imported from outside the module

### Module Map

```
src/
├── core/          # Pure domain logic, no framework deps
├── domain/        # Business entities and rules
├── infrastructure/# External integrations (db, api, auth)
├── features/      # Feature-specific code, isolated from each other
│   ├── feature-a/
│   └── feature-b/
├── shared/        # Cross-cutting utilities and UI primitives
└── ui/            # Presentation layer, thin wrappers
```

---

## Separation of Concerns

Define what belongs where.

### Principles

- **Business logic** lives in `domain/` or `core/`, never in UI components or API handlers
- **Data access** (API calls, DB queries) is isolated in `infrastructure/` — never inline in components or services
- **Presentation logic** (what to show, how to lay out) stays in UI components — no business rules
- **Configuration** is centralized, not scattered as inline values

---

## Dependency Direction

### Principles

- Dependencies point inward: UI → Features → Domain → Core
- Abstractions define interfaces; concretions implement them
- Domain code defines what it needs; infrastructure provides it (dependency inversion)
- No upward or circular dependencies

---

## Naming & Organization

### Principles

- Names reflect the **domain language**, not the technical role (e.g., `Invoice` not `InvoiceManager`)
- One concept, one name — avoid synonyms across the codebase
- File names match their primary export
- Group by feature/domain, not by file type (e.g., `invoicing/` not `components/`)

---

## Data Flow

### Principles

- State is owned by the module that's most responsible for it — not passed through long chains
- Side effects (API calls, file writes, timers) are explicit and contained in infrastructure or hooks
- Derived state is computed, not duplicated
- Props/data flow down; events/actions flow up

---

## Extensibility

### Principles

- New features should follow the same module pattern without modifying existing modules
- Configuration values are never hardcoded in logic — use config files or environment variables
- Extension points (plugins, hooks, middleware) are the intended way to add behavior, not modification of core code

---

## Anti-Patterns to Watch For

These are signs that the architecture is degrading:

- A file importing from 5+ modules — likely doing too much
- "Manager", "Handler", "Service", "Util" as suffixes on the same concept
- Business logic checking `if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production')`
- Components that fetch their own data (should be passed down or via hooks)
- Circular imports (A imports B imports A)
- Deep import paths like `../../../../core/something`
- Any file over 300 lines that isn't a configuration or data file
